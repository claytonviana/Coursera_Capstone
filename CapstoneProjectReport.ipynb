    "The Airport restaurants with more passenger traffic need to serve a diverse and multicultural population. Most people choose airports fast food restaurant because of lack of time between airplane connections but other people eat at the fast food restaurant because there are no other restaurants. The analysis of the number of restaurants per airport can indicate the percentage of fast-food restaurants and other restaurants and give new insights on the proposition.\n",

Futhermore, we explain how the data will be transformed and stored into a pandas dataframe. Then, we collect the longitude and latitude from each airport list using the Geocoder API.\n",

We then run an API call to get the geographic location with the **longitude and latitude data** for each airport and add them to the airport list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step was to run the Foursquare API to identify **the first 100 venues with the category \"Food\" within a radius of 1000 meters** close to each airport. This information was stored in a second list. Then the list of airports and the venue list were merged to begin the analysis exploring.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first analysis was the segmentation of the type of venue for each airport and the identification of the **10 most common categories of restaurants in the airports**. It is important to mention that the restaurant and the type of venue will be listed according to the frequency of check-in of Foursquare users.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second analysis used the **K-means method to cluster the airports into 5 groups** according to the restaurants category.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last analysis compared the results of each group and what the airports's restaurants have in common."
